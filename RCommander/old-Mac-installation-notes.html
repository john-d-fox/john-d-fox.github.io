    <h1 class="sans-serif-blue" align="center">R Commander Mac OS X
      Installation Notes for Versions of R Before R 3.0.0</h1>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">These installation notes are
      intended for Mac OS X users of versions of R prior to R 3.0.0. R
      version 3.0.0 comes with an X-Windows installation of Tcl/Tk, and
      it is thus unnecessary to install Tcl/Tk for X Windows in a
      separate step. </p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">I <strong>strongly recommend
        that you upgrade</strong> to the current version of R, and then
      follow the <a href="installation-notes.html">standard R Commander
        installation notes for Mac OS X users</a>. Using an old version
      of R will restrict you to an old version of the R Commander as
      well, and these old versions are now unsupported.</p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">The <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">Rcmdr</span> package is a standard R package, and it
      installs and
      is loaded in the normal manner. There are, however, a few
      installation issues on Macintosh systems, and these are described
      in this document.</p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">A general point is keep is mind
      is that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rcmdr</span> package
      uses
      a number of other "contributed" packages (in addition to packages,
      such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">tcltk</span> and <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">MASS</span>, that are part of the
      standard R distribution), and these
      must be present for it to work properly:&nbsp;<span
        style="font-weight: bold;">abind</span>, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">aplpack</span>,<span
        style="font-weight: bold;"> car</span>, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">colorspace, effects</span>, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Hmisc</span>, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">leaps</span>, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">lmtest</span>, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">multcomp</span>, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">relimp</span>, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">rgl</span>. Many of these packages
      have their own dependencies, which depend on still other packages,
      etc.</p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">Once it is installed, to load the
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rcmdr</span> package, just enter
      the
      command <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">library(Rcmdr)</font>.</p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left"> <span style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
        procedure for installing the R Commander under Mac OS X for
        versions of R prior to 3.0.0 is a bit
        complicated, so please read and follow these instructions
        carefully.
        These instructions and the associated files are intended for Mac
        OS X
        10.5 (Leopard), 10.6 (Snow Leopard), 10.7 (Lion), and 10.8
        (Mountain Lion) systems. I assume that you've already installed
        R.</span></p>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li>Check
        to see if the X11 windowing system (X Windows) has already been
        installed on your computer. For <strong>OS X 10.5, 10.6, and
          10.7</strong>, the file X11.app
        should appear&nbsp;in the Utilities folder under Applications in
        the
        finder. This application should always be installed under OS X
        10.7. If X11.app is missing under OS X 10.5 or 10.6, you can
        install it from your Mac OS X
        installation disc as follows:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <ul>
        <li>Insert your Mac OS X install disc. (If you have two discs it
          will be on the"Install Disc 1").</li>
        <li>Double click on Optional Installs.</li>
        <li>Double click on Optional Installs.mpkg, then click
          Continue&nbsp;and accept the license agreement.</li>
        <li>Click the triangle next to Applications in order to expand
          the list of applications.</li>
        <li>Check "X11", and then click Continue and Install. Click
          Close when the installation finishes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Under <strong>OS X 10.8</strong> (Mountain Lion), the X11
        application is called XQuartz.app, and it is no longer included
        with the operating system. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you first try to use X11, however -- for example, by
          installing and then loading the Rcmdr package in R (see the
          bullets below) -- OS X will offer to help you install X11,
          with a message like "To open 'R,' you need to install X11.
          Would you like to install X11 now?" </li>
        <li>Click the continue button, which will take you to the Apple
          support website, and thence to <a
            href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org">http://xquartz.macosforge.org</a>,
          where you can download the disk image (dmg) file for XQuartz.
        </li>
        <li>When you open this file by double-clicking on it, you'll
          find XQuartz.pkg; double-click on it to run the installer,
          clicking through all the defaults. </li>
        <li>After the installer runs, you'll have to log out and back on
          to your Mac OS X account.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li>Install Tcl/Tk for X Windows. Note that this step is necessary
        only for versions of R prior to R 3.0.0. <a
          href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/">Installers</a>
        (tcltk-8.5.5-x11.dmg or tcltk-8.5.5-x11.pkg) for various
        versions of Mac OS X are available</li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <ul>
        <li>Install
          Tcl/Tk for X Windows by double-clicking on the downloaded file
          tcltk-8.5.5-x11.dmg and then double-clicking on the installer
          file
          tcltk.pkg, or by double-clicking on the downloaded file
          tcltk-8.5.5-x11.pkg.</li>
        <li>Under <strong>OS X 10.8</strong> (Mountain Lion), depending
          upon how your security preferences are set, you may see the
          message, "'tcltk.pkg' can't be opened because it is from an
          unidentified developer." At this point, you can proceed by
          clicking OK to close the message box; then right-clicking (or
          control-clicking) tcltk.pkg; and finally clicking the Open
          button in the resulting dialog box. On the other hand, you
          might get tired of Apple trying to restrict the software that
          you install on your Mac, and simply change your security and
          privacy preferences to "allow applications downloaded from
          anywhere."</li>
        <li>Continue through the&nbsp;installation. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li>Start
        R by running R.app. At the R &gt; command prompt, type the
        following
        command and press the return key&nbsp;(to avoid errors, you can
        copy
        the command from this document and paste it at the R &gt;
        command
        prompt):</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">install.packages("Rcmdr")</span><br
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">R
      will ask you to select a CRAN mirror; pick a mirror site near you.
      <br>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Once it
          is installed, to load the <strong>Rcmdr</strong> package,
          simply issue the command</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
          style="font-family: monospace;"> library(Rcmdr)</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">at the R
          &gt; command prompt and press return. When you first load the
          <strong>Rcmdr</strong> package, it will offer to download and
          install missing
          dependencies; allow it to do so. Note that under Mac OS X 10.8
          (Mountain Lion) you will likely have to install XQuartz.app at
          this point (see above).<br>
