        Commander Installation Notes</span></h1>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">The <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">Rcmdr</span> package is a standard R package, and it
      installs and is loaded in the normal manner. There are, however, a
      few installation issues, particularly on Macintosh systems, and
      these are described in this document.</p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">For more detailed basic
      installation instructions, see Ch. 2 of my book <a
        href="index.html" moz-do-not-send="true">Using the R Commander</a>.</p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">A general point is keep in mind
      is that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rcmdr</span> package
      uses a number of other "contributed" packages (in addition to
      packages, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">tcltk</span>
      and <span style="font-weight: bold;">MASS</span>, that are part
      of the standard R distribution), and these must be present for it
      to work properly. Many of these packages have their own
      dependencies, which depend on still other packages, etc. These
      additional packages will either be installed along with the <strong>Rcmdr</strong>
      package or the <strong>Rcmdr</strong> will offer to install them
      when it first starts up (and you should accept the offer).</p>
    <h2 class="sans-serif-blue" align="left">General Installation
      Procedure</h2>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">The following instructions may be
      all you need to get started; for more detailed instructions and
      potential installation issues, see the various sections below.
      These instructions assume that you have an active Internet
      connection.</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="sans-serif"><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/"
          moz-do-not-send="true">Download
          R from CRAN</a> and install it in the manner appropriate to
        your operating system. If you have an old version of R -- that
        is, older than the current version -- then it's generally a good
        idea to install the current version of R before installing the <strong>Rcmdr</strong>
        package. On Windows, opt for a customized startup and select the
        single-document interface ("SDI," see the Windows notes below
        for details).</li>
      <li class="sans-serif">On macOS only, <a
          href="https://www.xquartz.org/" moz-do-not-send="true">download
          and install XQuartz</a>,
        and reboot your computer (see the Mac notes below for greater
        detail).</li>
      <li class="sans-serif">Start R, and at the <span
          class="typewrite-font">&gt;</span> command prompt, type the
        command <span class="typewriterFont">install.packages("Rcmdr")</span></li>
      <li class="sans-serif">Once it is installed, to load the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Rcmdr</span> package, just enter
        the command <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">library(Rcmdr)</font></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="sans-serif-blue" align="left">General Installation Issues</h2>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">Not really an <i>installation</i>
      issue, but a common problem on all platforms: If you save the R
      workspace when you exit from R (which, unfortunately, is the
      out-of-the-box default at the end of a session on all platforms
      and in RStudio), then you can expect to experience problems when
      the saved workspace is loaded at the start of subsequent sessions.
      The preemptive remedy is never to save the R workspace at the end
      of a session. If you do save the workspace on exiting from R, the
      remedy is to delete the file in which the workspace is saved,
      which is named <span class="sans-serif"><span
          class="typewrite-font">.RData</span></span>.&nbsp; Files with
      names beginning with a period are&nbsp; (again unfortunately)
      generally hidden from the Windows File Explorer and the macOS
      Finder. To reveal <span class="sans-serif"><span
          class="typewrite-font">.RData</span></span> in Windows File
      Explorer, <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/common-file-name-extensions-in-windows-da4a4430-8e76-89c5-59f7-1cdbbc75cb01">see
these
        instructions</a>; in macOS Finder, <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-access-your-macs-hidden-files">see
these
        instructions</a>. Finally, If you exit from R directly
      from the R Commander, the R workspace isn't saved.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">Occasionally, an R package or
      packages required by the <strong>Rcmdr</strong> package fails to
      be installed and the R Commander can't start. When this happens,
      there is typically an informative error message about the missing
      package(s). There are two common causes for this problem: (1) The
      package(s) in question may be temporarily missing from the CRAN
      mirror that you used; or (2) the package(s) may be permanently
      unavailable for an older version of R. </p>
    <p align="left"><span class="sans-serif">In the first instance, you
        can install (each) missing package directly via the command <span
          class="typewrite-font">install.packages("<em>package-name</em>")</span>,
        or, for more than one missing package, <span
          class="typewrite-font">install.packages(c("<em>package-1-name</em>",
          "<em>package-2-name</em>", <em>etc</em>))</span></span> , <span
        class="sans-serif">selecting a different CRAN mirror from the
        one you used initially. In the second instance, you can install
        the current version of R (always a good idea), and start again.</span></p>
    <p class="sans-serif">If you wish to start the R Commander
      automatically when R starts up, you can add a plain-text ("ascii")
      file named <span class="typewrite-font">.Rprofile</span> to your
      home directory, with the following contents:</p>
    <p class="sans-serif"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">local({<br>
        old &lt;- getOption("defaultPackages")<br>
        options(defaultPackages = c(old, "Rcmdr"))<br>
        })</font></p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">To determine your home directory,
      type the command <span class="typewrite-font">getwd()</span>
      ("get working directory") at the <span class="typewrite-font">&gt;</span>
      command prompt in a fresh R session. Be sure to use a plain-text
      editor to create this file, not a word processor like Word, or, if
      using a word processor, to save the file as a plain-text file.</p>
    <h2 class="sans-serif-blue" align="left">Notes for specific
      platforms</h2>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">If the general installation
      procedure and installation issues above are insufficient, here is
      specific information for Windows, Linux, and macOS systems:</p>
    <h3 class="sans-serif-blue" align="left">Windows Installation</h3>
    <p align="left"><span class="sans-serif">The easiest way to install
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rcmdr</span> package is
        via the Rgui <i>Packages -&gt; Install packages</i>
        menu or via the command </span><span class="typewrite-font">install.packages("Rcmdr")</span><span
        class="sans-serif"> entered at the R </span><span
        class="typewrite-font">&gt;</span><span class="sans-serif">
        command prompt. R will ask you to select a CRAN mirror; pick the
        first, "0-Cloud" mirror, or a mirror site near you.</span></p>
    <p align="left"><span class="sans-serif">When you first load the <strong>Rcmdr</strong>
        package with the command <span class="typewrite-font">library("Rcmdr")</span>,
        it will offer to download and install missing dependencies;
        allow it to do so.&nbsp;If you installed R in </span><span
        class="typewrite-font" style="font-family: monospace;">Program
        Files</span><span class="sans-serif">, you may prefer to run R
        with adminstrator privileges to install packages:&nbsp;Right
        click the R icon and select "Run as administrator." Otherwise,
        packages will be installed in a package library particular to
        your user account rather than the main R package library; that
        should work OK too. I suggest that you install R into a
        different
        directory, such as <span style="font-family: monospace;">C:\R\</span>,
        to avoid this issue. </span></p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">On Windows, the <strong>Rcmdr</strong>
      package works best with the "single-document "R interface (SDI).
      Under the default "multiple-document interface" (MDI), R Commander
      dialog boxes may not stay on top of the main R window. In the <em>Startup</em>
      options screen of the R installer, select <em>Yes</em>
      (customized startup). Then select the SDI (single-document
      interface) in preference to the default MDI (multiple-document
      interface); feel free to make other changes, but you may take all
      the remaining defaults.</p>
    <p><span class="sans-serif">If you install R with the standard MDI,
        to enable the SDI you can make a copy of the R desktop icon
        (right-click on the icon, drag it to a different location on the
        desktop, select<i> Copy Here</i> from the context menu).
        Right-click the new icon and select <i>Properties</i>. Add <font
          class="typewrite-font" face="monospace">--sdi</font> (preceded
        by a space) to the <i>Target</i> field on the <i>Shortcut </i>tab
of
        the <i>Properties</i> dialog box. The field should read
        something like</span> <span class="typewrite-font"><font
          face="monospace">"C:\Program Files\R\R-<em>x.y.z</em>\bin\Rgui.exe"
          --sdi</font>,</span><span class="sans-serif"> where <font
          class="typewrite-font" face="monospace"><em>x.y.z</em></font>
        specifies the version of R you installed. If you wish, change
        the name of the icon on the <i>General</i> tab (e.g., to <i>R
          x.y.z SDI</i>). Click <i>OK</i>. Alternatively, you canyou
        can edit the </span><span class="typewrite-font"
        style="font-family: monospace;">Rconsole</span><span
        class="sans-serif"> file in R's </span><span
        class="typewrite-font" style="font-family: monospace;">etc</span><span
        class="sans-serif"> subdirectory to select the SDI.</span></p>
    <h3 class="sans-serif-blue" align="left">Linux/Unix Installation</h3>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">Linux/Unix systems typically have
      all of the software required for building packages already
      installed. The easiest way to install the <strong>Rcmdr</strong>
      package is to run R as root and issue the command <font
        face="Courier New, Courier, mono">install.packages("Rcmdr")</font>
      at the R prompt.&nbsp; R will ask you to select a CRAN mirror;
      pick the first, "0-Cloud" mirror, or a mirror site near you.</p>
    <p class="sans-serif" align="left">On Ubutu systems, in particular,
      the following procedure should work (slightly modified from a
      suggestion by Ista Zahn):</p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">These
      instructions are for R version 3.6.1 or later; if you're using an
      earlier version of R, I suggest that you upgrade (in fact, it's
      generally a good idea to upgrade to the current version of R), or,
      failing that, consult the special <a

      complicated.</p>

      <li class="sans-serif"><span style="font-family:

          Commander, make sure that your macOS system is up-to-date by
          running Software Update from the "apple" menu at the top-left
          of the screen. This is important, because R assumes that the

    <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As part of
        the installation process, XQuartz builds a font cache.
        Occasionally, the font cache isn't built on installation, and
        instead the cache is built when the R Commander (and hence
        XQuartz) is first used. This process can be time-consuming and
        may initially slow down the performance of the R Commander
        (with, e.g., dialog boxes taking a long time to display); if
        this problem occurs, please be patient -- the problem should
        resolve itself after the font cache is built.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sans-serif">If you are using macOS 10.9
        ("Mavericks") or later and the R Commander becomes slow or
        unresponsive during a session, you can run R and the R Commander
        in a terminal window on your Mac rather than from R.app or
        prevent your computer from "napping" while R.app is running. See
        "Suppressing app nap" in the installation notes above.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Occasionally,
the
        <strong>Rcmdr</strong> package will fail to load properly
        in macOS. When this problem occurs, the cause is almost always
        the failure of the <strong>tcltk</strong> package to load --The
        <strong>Rcmdr</strong> package depends on the <strong>tcltk</strong>
        package. You can confirm this diagnosis by trying to load the <strong>tcltk</strong>
        package directly, in a fresh R session, issuing the command <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">library(tcltk)</span>at the R
        command prompt.</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you
          are running R version 3.1.2, the <strong>tcltk</strong>
          package may fail to load with a message like the following.
          This is due to a bug in R 3.1.2, which assumes that the <em>otool</em>
          utility is installed on your system, and which fails if it is
          not. The simplest fix is to install a newer version of R.</span></li>
